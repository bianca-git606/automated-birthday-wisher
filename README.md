# automated-birthday-wisher
SUMMARY: This code checks the current date and compare it against a csv file of your friends' birthdays.
If it happens that it's someone's birthday, it will choose from any of the three birthday greeting letters, 
replace the nameholder in the letter with your friend's name and sends them a greeting via email.
